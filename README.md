Ronald Fisher was a British statistician and geneticist and is regarded as the single most important figure in 20th century statistics[1]. Fisher and in particular the Iris Flower Data Set played a significant role in pattern recognition and discriminant analysis which in turn is important in the area of Data Analytics . Data Analysis can be described as the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modelling data with the aim of determining valuable information, suggesting conclusions and supporting decision making[2]

The Iris Flower Data-set is an excellent example of a resource that has become a mainstay of the computing world, particularly for testing purposes. New types of sorting and taxonomy models often use the data set as an input to examine how different technologies will sort and handle data sets. The Iris set might be used by a programmer for the purposes of testing a decision tree, or a piece of machine learning software. This is the reason the Iris Flower Data-Set is so interesting to programmers, and such is its popularity, the data-set is built into some coding libraries (techopedia.com). The Iris dataset has been analysed via two separate methods. First, plotted the dataset onto scatterplots to determine patterns in the data in relation to the Iris classifications. Second, developed an application in Java that will run a series of methods on the dataset to extract relevant statistical evidence (Hoey,P).

## The Importance of Data Analytics 

Data is considered the raw material if the 21st century (1). With the availability of data with huge volume, velocity and variety has come the potential to lead to enhance a firms decision making performance with the associated competitive advantage (Chen et al, 2012). Decision makers need to be able to gain valuable insights from such quickly fluctuating data by using big data analytics, this will enable them to make better, more informed, and faster decisions.
