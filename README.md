Ronald Fisher was a British statistician and geneticist and is regarded as the single most important figure in 20th century statistics[1]. Fisher and in particular the Iris Flower Data Set played a significant role in pattern recognition which in turn is important in the area of Data Analytics . Data Analysis can be described as the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modelling data with the aim of determining valuable information, suggesting conclusions and supporting decision making[2]

The Iris Flower Dataset is an example for discriminant analysis. The goal of a discriminant analysis is produce a simple function that, given the four measurements, will categorise a flower correctly. It is the beginning of creating 'predictors', to try and form a more educated presumption on a dataset[3].

## The Importance of data Analytics 

Data is considered the raw material if the 21st century (1). With the availability of data with huge volume, velocity and variety has come the potential to lead to enhance a firms decision making performance with the associated competitive advantage (Chen et al, 2012). Decision makers need to be able to gain valuable insights from such quickly fluctuating data by using big data analytics, this will enable them to make better, more informed, and faster decisions.
