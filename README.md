Ronald Fisher was a British statistician and geneticist and is regarded as the single most important figure in 20th century statistics[1]. Fisher and in particular the Iris Flower Data Set played a significant role in pattern recognition and discriminant analysis which in turn is important in the area of Data Analytics . Data Analysis can be described as the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modelling data with the aim of determining valuable information, suggesting conclusions and supporting decision making[2]

## The Dataset

The Iris Flower Dataset is an excellent example of a resource that has become a mainstay of the computing world, particularly for testing purposes. New types of sorting and taxonomy models often use the dataset as an input to examine how different technologies will sort and handle datasets. The Iris dataset might be used by a programmer for the purposes of testing a decision tree, or a piece of machine learning software. This is the reason the Iris Flower Dataset is so interesting to programmers, and such is its popularity, the dataset is built into some coding libraries (techopedia.com). The Iris dataset has been analysed via two separate methods. First, plotted the dataset onto scatterplots to determine patterns in the data in relation to the Iris classifications. Second, developed an application in Java that will run a series of methods on the dataset to extract relevant statistical evidence (Hoey,P).

## The Importance of Data Analytics 

Data is considered the raw material if the 21st century (1). With the availability of data with huge volume, velocity and variety has come the potential to lead to enhance a firms decision making performance with the associated competitive advantage (Chen et al, 2012). Decision makers need to be able to gain valuable insights from such quickly fluctuating data by using big data analytics, this will enable them to make better, more informed, and faster decisions. In a report by PWC, they propose that all majors should require some foundational knowledge of analytics and the data science process. Data visualisation is an excellent example of such knowledge as it mixes art and science, helping students use data to express themselves in creative ways.[4] According to Oracle, in 2013 organisations were generating 300TB of data weekly (Ward, J & Barker,A 2013). This poses a significant challenge, and oppertunity as companies need to get as much value as possible from this data. Later on we will look at how Python can analyse the Iris Dataset which is a small but not insignifcant set.

## Why Python?

There are many reasons why I chose to use Python to analyse the data. Firstly, as a beginner to programming it is easy to an easy to understand and relatively easy to learn language. As it is a very high-level language it reads like English, taking much of the syntax learning away. Another advantage of Python is that it has extensive support libraries that are useful for document generation, image manipulation, databases and many more. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++. It is also cross platform so can run on many operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linus and Mac OS X. Python is free and open source, and there are many websites that provide useful insights to Python and are happy to help with any programming problems you might encounter! I will show later how a few simple lines of code enabled me to intergate the data with useful results and graphs that perhaps will challenge those results.


## Analysing the Data

1. [The maximun length of each column](https://github.com/Gerrydh/Project-2018/blob/master/Python%20Scripts/Max%20and%20Min%20by%20species.py)

Clicking on the link above will bring us into the code used to return the maximum and minimum value of each of the columns from the dataset. As you can see just a few lines of code were required to return these values, including the species of each flower. This we can quickly see the values and the species neatly formatted as shown in the picture below.
